## CP1401 - PROGRAMMING II

This repository contains all the solutions of programming II practicals and is created by Chirag Verma having student id - jc946808.

### The three main lessons learned about "clean code":

- **Formatting** - The code should be neatly formatted. it should start with a docstring, then import statement and
  after that the code.
- **SRP** - Every function should follow the single responsibility process. a function should always do one task not
  more than that.
- **Naming convention** - Learned naming convention rules for different things such as a class name should always start
  with a capital letter.
