# Practical 10

- Throughout the coarse, my accuracy in estimating practical tasks improved significantly. In the beginning, I tended
  to underestimate the time needed for the tasks, but as I gained more experience, I became better at estimating. By the
  end of the subject, I was able to accurately estimate the time needed for most tasks.
- ## Reflection on Practical Tasks Estimates

During the practical tasks, I found that my accuracy in estimating the amount of time required to complete a task
improved as I became more familiar with the programming concepts being taught. Initially, I struggled with accurately
estimating the time required to complete the tasks, but as I gained more experience, I found that my estimates became
more accurate.

## Reflection on Code Reviews

Participating in code reviews has been an extremely valuable experience for me. From being reviewed, I have learned how
to improve my code by receiving feedback from others on how to make my code more readable, efficient and effective. In
addition, reviewing other people's code has allowed me to learn new techniques and best practices that I can apply to my
own code. I have also learned how to communicate effectively and respectfully with others when giving feedback on their
code.

## Reflection on Practical Tasks Overall

Overall, I found the practical tasks to be a challenging but rewarding experience. The tasks were well-designed and
provided a good balance between theory and practical application. If I were in charge of the subject, I would consider
providing more structured guidance on how to approach the tasks, as I found that I sometimes struggled with knowing
where to start. Additionally, I would consider incorporating more real-world examples and applications to help reinforce
the concepts being taught.
