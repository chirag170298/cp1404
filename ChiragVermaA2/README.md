# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by CHIRAG VERMA

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights
> insights made during code development.

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?

- I spent approximately 7-8 days on this project.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

- I am most satisfied with the overall structure and functionality of the program. I feel that the program meets all the
  requirements outlined in the assignment brief and is easy to use.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

- I am least satisfied with the way I spent so much time on the small things. While I tried to accomplish code
  requirements, there are some times when I ignored little things and got an error. I spent too much time in fixing that
  and in the end the error was about putting '()' in front of ListProperty In future projects, I will
  aim to correct this habit.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

- One thing that worked well in my development process was breaking down the project requirements into smaller tasks and
  working on them one by one. This helped me to focus on each requirement and ensure that I was meeting all the
  specifications.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

- One thing I could improve on in the future is better time management. I spent too much time on some tasks and not
  enough time on others, which resulted in some features being rushed. In future projects, I will try to allocate a set
  amount
  of time to each task and prioritize them based on their importance.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.

- During the project, I mainly used the lecture notes, course material (videos and kivy demo) and python documentation
  whenever I stuck somewhere or need to refresh my memory on specific topics.
  topics.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

- One of the main challenges I faced was understanding how to use the Kivy and KivyMD library to create a responsive and
  well-designed user interface. To overcome this, I spent time studying the examples provided in the Kivy demos and
  KivyMD. Also, I experiment with different layouts and widgets until that worked well.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.

- I found using classes to be very useful in this project. It allowed me to organize the code more effectively and make
  it more modular. The PlaceCollection class allowed me to encapsulate all the data and methods related to a place in a
  single object, which made the code more readable and easier to understand. Overall, it gives a neat look to code.
  Classes also made testing easy for me as I can create multiple instances of the same class to test. In a simpler way, using classes improved
  the quality of my code, made it more maintainable in the long run and easier to debug.
